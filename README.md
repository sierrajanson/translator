Translator
Sierra Janson | November 2023 
Input language through microphone or by uploading a phototage and select a language for it to be translated to. Using React JS and Tesseract. 

Future Ideas:
- camera translation (need to adjust words only when change spotted instead of constantly)
- offline translation
- app

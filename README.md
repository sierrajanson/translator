Sierra Janson | November 2023

Future Ideas:
- camera translation (need to adjust words only when change spotted instead of constantly)
- offline functionality
- app
- having the speaker speak into phone, and have live updates of the transcript on all of the listeners' phones --> listeners have ability to signal that they don't understand/wish speaker to speak slower/quicker
- get opinions of people with Limited English Proficiency to see what features would be useful to them

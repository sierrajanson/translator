Translator
Sierra Janson | November 2023 
Input language through microphone or by uploading a phototage and select a language for it to be translated to. Using React JS, Tesseract, Translate DeepL, and React Speech Recognition.

Future Ideas:
- camera translation (need to adjust words only when change spotted instead of constantly)
- offline functionality
- app
- aving the speaker speak into phone, and have live updates of the transcript on all of the listeners' phones --> listeners have ability to signal that they don't understand/wish speaker to speak slower/quicker
- get opinions of people with Limited English Proficiency to see what features would be useful to them
